      "answer": "Interest on your loan accrues daily. It is for this reason that the portion of your monthly payment allocated to interest may fluctuate to match the number of days in each month. To calculate the interest due on your loan, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Obtain the new principal balance of your loan from your Online Banking Account Services page or the automated phone service.\n\n2.  Multiply your principal balance by your interest rate. Divide your answer by 365 days (366 days in a leap year) to find your daily interest accrual or your per diem.\n\n3.  Multiply this amount by the number of calendar days that have elapsed since the date of your last payment to find your interest due.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n1.  $10,000 principal balance.\n\n2.  $10,000 multiplied by 8.5% interest divided by 365 days in the year = $2.33 per diem.\n\n3.  $2.33 multiplied by 33 days elapsed since the date of your last payment = $76.85.
