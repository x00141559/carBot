## The new BF CLI replaces legacy standalone tools

The Bot Framework SDK team is happy to announce the General Availability of the consolidated bot framework CLI tool [bf-cli](https://aka.ms/bfcli). The new BF CLI tool will replace legacy standalone tools to manage Bot Framework bots and related services. The old tools will be ported over in phases and all new features, bug fixes, and further investments will focus on the new BF CLI.  Old tools will still work for the time being, but they are going to be deprecated in future releases.

Upon the release of Bot Framework SDK version 4.6 the following legacy tools have been ported: Chatdown, QnAMaker, LuisGen, and LuDown.

To learn more about the BF CLI please visit the [BF CLI github repository](https://aka.ms/bfcli).

## QnAMaker

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/qnamaker.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/qnamaker)

QnAMaker is a command line tool and a library for interacting with QnAMaker service using the QnAMaker REST API.

## Prerequisite

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 8.5 or higher

## Installation

### As a CLI
Make sure you have Node.js >=8.5 and npm installed on your machine, then use:

`npm install -g qnamaker`

### As a library
The QnAMaker APIs can be installed and used as a library in any Node.js or JavaScript UI projects for the browser:

`npm install -s qnamaker`

You can then import and use service classes specific to the endpoint and operation you wish to call.

## Configuration
A configuration object is required to provide the endpoint base path, app ID, version ID and the 
authoring key to each outbound call. There are 3 ways to provide this information to the CLI:

1. As a `.qnamakerrc` file in the cwd. 
The JSON format for the `.qnamakerrc` file:
```json
{
  "subscriptionKey": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "kbId": "xxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx",
  "hostname": "https://xxxxxx.azurewebsites.net",
  "endpointKey": "xxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx"
}
```

> NOTE: Simply run `qnamaker init` to answer simple questions to create your .qnamakerrc file

2. As arguments to the CLI: `--kbId <string> --subscriptionKey <string>`

3. As environment variables: `QNAMAKER_KBID`, `QNAMAKER_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`, `QNAMAKER_ENDPOINTKEY`, `QNAMAKER_HOSTNAME`

The CLI will first look for these named configuration variables in the arguments list, then inside the `.qnamakerrc` file, then fallback to the environment variables. 

### Securing Your Access Key
To better secure your access key, it is recommended to omit the key from the `.qnamakerrc` 
file and instead pass it in to the `--subscriptionKey` argument or store it as the `QNAMAKER_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` 
environment variable. If security is not a concern for your particular case, all configuration items 
can be stored in the `.qnamakerrc` for convenience.

### Overriding Configurations
Since configuration items can be passed as arguments to the CLI, using arguments to specify 
the configuration will override the `.qnamakerrc` and any environment variables that may have been specified.

## Nightly builds

Nightly builds are based on the latest development code which means they may or may not be stable and probably won't be documented. These builds are better suited for more experienced users and developers although everyone is welcome to give them a shot and provide feedback.

You can get the latest nightly build of QnAMaker from the [BotBuilder MyGet](https://botbuilder.myget.org/gallery) feed. To install the nightly - 

```shell
npm config set registry https://botbuilder.myget.org/F/botbuilder-tools-daily/npm/
```

Install using npm:
```shell
npm i -g qnamaker
```

To reset registry:
